The idea of this project is to provide a simple AngularJS Routing

## Goal: To provide a simple html application with multiple (partial views) with angular routing
1) Provide separate controllers for each views
2) Angular ui.router provider to handle the routing
3) Controlers folder - contains all the controller files
4) css & scripts have the style and app js file

## Running the example
The example can be run by running the attached "Main.html" using your web/node server

http://localhost/AngularRouting/Main.html

## Explanation of the project

1) Main.html - main html page that hosts the other views
2) App.js - sources the routing logic
3) maincontroller, controllerA, controllerB - sources simple controllers feeding respective htmls
4) style.css - sample css
